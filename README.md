#Techtalk
<h4>Intro</h4>
So my friend Louis and I started this small blog and podcast, and even though it's kinda sparsely updated, it works quite nicely for us 
as a creative outlet.

<h4>Code</h4>
Even though it's not really programming, the amount of work put into this site is fairly tremendous. Three redesigns have gone down in 
less than three months, and trying to integrate HTML5 (which, incidentally, isn't compatible with Blogger's XML wrapping) is a toughie. 
Firstly, I began by changing around some elements within the original theme. Styling was of little concern: I changed the ``div`` 
structure to something that I liked, and then went from there. I've also tried integrating a completely separate fixed menu bar, but I 
have yet to do that.

<h4>Colors</h4>
I kinda used a bad amount of colors.

Color | Use | Source
------|------|-------
#000 | text, headings, and links |standard color
#E8E8EE | borders | light grey hex search
#3B5998 | facebook button hover | Facebook's color repository
#1DCAFF | twitter button hover | Twitter's color repository
#FF6600 | soundcloud button hover | Soundcloud's color repository
#B31217 | rules border color, YouTube button hover, link hover color | Google's color repository
#FFDF00 | github button hover | light yellow color since I couldn't think of anything else

<h4>Fonts</h4>
I love fonts, too. I have a fairly wide collection of them now, and I keep finding more good ones on Google Webfonts.

Font | Use | Source
-----|-----|-------|
Roboto | main text, menu, header, and sidebar font | Google WebFonts
Droid Sans Mono | ``code`` font, resource list font | Google WebFonts
